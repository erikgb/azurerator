==Deployment==
developer -> cluster: apply YAML
cluster <- naiserator: read YAML
cluster <- naiserator: apply azurerator CRD
naiserator -> cluster: wait for synchronization
note over naiserator, cluster: mount expected secret

loop forever

==Create or update AAD app==
azurerator -> azurerator: check if app exists
note left: cached from AAD
azurerator -> azuread: check if app exists
alt app does not exist in AAD
	azurerator -> azuread: register new application
else app exists in AAD
    azurerator -> azuread: update application
    note left

==Provision credentials==

azurerator -> azurerator: generate new set of clientSecret and keypair
note over azurerator, azuread
    should not invalidate credentials for previous app that's still running
end note

azurerator -> azuread: assign the credentials to the AAD app as additional credentials

alt if rotating secrets
    azurerator -> cluster: check current KeyIds in status subresource
    azurerator -> azuread: invalidate non-matching KeyIds
    note over azurerator, azuread
        should ensure that credentials are invalidated on a given condition,
        and iff new, valid credentials are available and in use by apps
    end note

==Create or update cluster resources==
azurerator -> cluster: update with newly generated KeyIds in AzureAdApplication status subresource

alt resources do not exist
	azurerator -> cluster: create secret
	note right
        client secret
        private key

==Complete provisioning==
    azurerator -> cluster: update CR status
    azurerator -> cluster: complete reconciliation
    naiserator -> cluster: synchronized
    application -> cluster: deployed with mounted secret

==On deletion==
    naiserator -> cluster: delete resources
    azurerator -> azuread: delete application
    azurerator -> cluster: delete secret
    azurerator -> cluster: delete configMap
